Steps to run:
1. npm install
2. node index.js

If you wish to use newAge.js in html file then you would probably need to delete the last line of newAge.js (i.e. export default age) which was added by me so that the all the code could be made available to index.js but this might not be needed in case you're planning to use newAge.js in html file's <script src = "./newAge.js"></script>.
